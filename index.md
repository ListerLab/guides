These how-to guides provide instructions to help you get started quickly with many computational tasks in the Lister Lab. Some of these guides provide additional information and detail about working with our servers, Illumina Basespace, DNA sequence data, data transfer and sharing, genome browsers, and some best practices when using our shared computing resources.  

Simply browse through the expandable contents menu on the right hand side of this page. If you want to search for something specific, click the hamburger button at the top right of this page to access the search bar.  

If you would like to contribute to these guides, please contact Sam Buckberry who can add you as a contributor to the Lister Lab GitHub repository. Please see [how to contribute](./contribute) for more information.
