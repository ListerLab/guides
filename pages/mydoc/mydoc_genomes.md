### 1. Rationale

This guide describes the storage of reference sequences and annotation files for the commonly studied organisms in the Lister Lab. As many people in the lab use the same reference genomes, alignment algorithms and annotation files, it is much more efficient to store these data in a central and organised way. Below is a description of where to find common sequence, annotation and index files, and what to do if the files you need are not in the repository.

### 2. Where to find genome sequence, annotation and index files

#### Genome sequence files

| Organism     | Source | Build | Format | Path                                                                                            |
|--------------|--------|-------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Homo Sapiens | UCSC   | hg19  | fasta  | /home/lister/working_data_02/genomes/Homo_sapiens/UCSC/hg19/Sequence/WholeGenomeFasta/genome.fa |
| Homo Sapiens | UCSC   | hg38  |        |                                                                                                 |
|              |        |       |        |                                                                                                 |
